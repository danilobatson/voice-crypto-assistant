| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Microphone Access Denied**       | Voice button not responding       | Enable microphone permissions in browser settings               |
| **Speech Recognition Not Working** | Voice input not transcribing      | Use Chrome/Edge browser; check microphone hardware              |
| **LunarCrush 401 Unauthorized**    | "Invalid API key" error           | Verify API key format and active subscription at lunarcrush.com |
| **Gemini AI Errors**               | "AI analysis failed"              | Check Google AI API key and quota limits at aistudio.google.com |
| **Voice Output Not Playing**       | Silent responses                  | Check browser audio settings and autoplay policy                |
| **MCP Connection Timeout**         | Analysis stuck at connection step | Verify internet connectivity and LunarCrush API status          |

### Debug Workflow

**If voice features aren't working:**

1. ✅ **Check microphone permissions**: Browser settings → Privacy → Microphone
2. ✅ **Test in Chrome/Edge**: Best Web Speech API support
3. ✅ **Verify environment variables**: Both API keys in `.env.local`
4. ✅ **Check browser console**: Look for speech recognition errors
5. ✅ **Test manual input**: Use text input as fallback
6. ✅ **Clear cache**: Restart development server for fresh state
